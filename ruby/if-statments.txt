every if-statement must have an else
If this else should never run because it doesn't make sense, then you must use a die function in the else that puts out an error message and dies, just like we did in the last exercise.  This will find many errors
Never nest if-statements two deep and always try to do them one deep.
Treat if-statements like paragraphs, where each if-elsif-else grouping is like a set of sentences.  Put blank lines before and after.
Your boolean tests should be simple.  If they are complex, move their caculations to variables earlier in your function and use a good name for the variable.
